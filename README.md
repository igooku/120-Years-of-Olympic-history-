# 120-Years-of-Olympic-history-
This is a simple practice data analysis project. The aim is simply to learn Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and related Python-based data analysis tools.

## What is this?

This is a small data analysis project using the 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results from Kaggle. The questions that are being "answered" here are all made up. They'll probably get better (or seem more useful) in future revisions. The sole objective is learning.

The dataset has been downloaded and extracted into the data subdirectory. So there's no need to download it after cloning this repository.

## How to use this

To use this, you need the following Python libraries (in addition to Python itself, of course):

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
The simplest way to get all of these installed is to simply install Anaconda. The code in the notebooks uses Python 3.

To open the notebook, just run jupyter notebook from the project root directory.

## Prerequisites

This is about learning Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. One is expected to have Python knowledge (although I don't) and know how to use the Jupyter environment.

## Feedback?

Feedback is welcome....
